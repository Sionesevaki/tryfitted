A browser-based virtual fitting platform that lets online shoppers see how clothes fit on their own 3D body, directly on any clothing product page — with no retailer integration required.

Users create a lightweight 3D avatar once using photos and basic measurements, then browse online stores as usual. When they visit a clothing product page, a “Try fitted” button appears automatically. Clicking it opens an interactive 3D view that shows how the selected size fits their body — highlighting tight, regular, or loose areas — based on the user’s measurements, detected product information, and inferred garment sizing.

What the MVP ships with

Chrome desktop extension (laptops & desktops only)

One-time avatar creation from front + side photos

Highly optimized 3D body model for fast loading in the browser

Measurement-based fit analysis (tops only)

Lightweight 3D fit visualization using a garment proxy (not full cloth physics)

Automatic product-page detection on most fashion sites

AI-assisted extraction of product images, available sizes, size charts, and material details directly from the page

No retailer setup required — works instantly across existing e-commerce sites

The MVP focuses on speed, accuracy, and usability, giving shoppers confidence in sizing decisions without requiring any changes from retailers, while laying the groundwork for deeper integrations and advanced cloth simulation in future releases.
